//practice animating object properties - like torus outer ring radius, using SCN.commit(), etc.
//use  linked list to add a series of objects one after another - chian multiple functions together
//possibly use physics joints to connect the contact geometr with the outer ring geometry
//create a gameobject protocol for gameobjects (enemies, obstacles, and letters), whichc can be used in the encounter
//set up predefined spawn points in the the scene, enemies can spawn randomly at these spawn points
//practice animating field of view changes and point of view changes with the camera
