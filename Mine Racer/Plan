//HUD still needs to update
//Make the bullets more accurate
//make sure bullets are removed after a predefined time
//add sounds effects and music
//make app screen shots for appstore preview
//need to make sure pause button is reposition for switch to landscape
//make sure all nodes are removed - node removal functions are in place
//limit player movement to certain screen area
//include notifications to pause game when app resigns into background or comes back into foreground

//practice animating object properties - like torus outer ring radius, using SCN.commit(), etc.
//use  linked list to add a series of objects one after another - chian multiple functions together
//possibly use physics joints to connect the contact geometr with the outer ring geometry
//create a gameobject protocol for gameobjects (enemies, obstacles, and letters), whichc can be used in the encounter
//set up predefined spawn points in the the scene, enemies can spawn randomly at these spawn points
//practice animating field of view changes and point of view changes with the camera

//make a double-linked list by which operations can be obtained from each node elemenet, and dependencies can be added in reverse direction as well foward direction - traversing the linked list for operations and then once all the dependencies are configured, the operations can be added to an operation queue - the operation queues can then be started and cancelled
